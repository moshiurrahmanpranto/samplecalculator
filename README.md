#Scientific calculator

A scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics. They have almost completely replaced slide rules in traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings.

In certain contexts such as higher education, scientific calculators have been superseded by graphing calculators, which offer a superset of scientific calculator functionality along with the ability to graph input data and write and store programs for the device. There is also some overlap with the financial calculator market.


Why we choose C ?

C is the most commonly used programming language for writing operating systems. The first operating system written in C is Unix. Later operating systems like GNU/Linux were all written in C. Not only is C the language of operating systems, it is the precursor and inspiration for almost all of the most popular high-level  languages available today. In fact, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby are all written in C. 

By way of analogy, let's say that you were going to be learning Spanish, Italian, French, or Romanian. Do you think knowing Latin would be helpful? Just as Latin was the basis of all of those languages, knowing C will enable you to understand and appreciate an entire family of programming languages built upon the traditions of C. Knowledge of C enables freedom. Now  this days many programs ,games,and other calculation algogorithms are also written in C

Why C, and not assembly language?

While assembly language can provide speed and maximum control of the program, C provides portability.

Different processors are programmed using different Assembly languages and having to choose and learn only one of them is too arbitrary. In fact, one of the main strengths of C is that it combines universality and portability across various computer architectures while retaining most of the control of the hardware provided by assembly language.Assembly, while extremely powerful, is simply too difficult to program large applications and hard to read or interpret in a logical way. C is a compiled language, which creates fast and efficient executable files. It is also a small “what you see is all you get” language: a C statement corresponds to at most a handful of assembly statements, everything else is provided by library functions.  

	
#Features

In our scientific calculator program you will able to use different features of calculation.


1. You can use add and substract any numbers. And also you can use different types of number that you want.

2.You can multiply and divide between the numbers.

3.You can also find out the different angles value of trigonometric number such as Sin , Cos & tan etc and also inverse.

4.You can also find out qube,square and also root of a number.

5.And also you can find out the factorial of a number and also it can calculate the value of ln

	
#Process

How did we make this calculator in C ?
1. First of all we have to make a C program because our scientific calculator is in C program


2.Then we  have given a fine introduction using printf and also showed many options


3.We have given 11 options where the sum of all calculations are included such as add,subtract,multiply,factorial,ln etc


4.to access all the options  we have used scanf to know which one and conditional statement(if,if else)

5. after one operation if you get the ability to calculate something again thats why we have used loop statement of while

6.we have used  the double integer to print the output with floating point number

7. in this program our target was to give the proper and accurate value of every math of calculations

#Challanges
We have to face many challenges to create this program. Somtimes it was very hard and sometimes it was easy to show what we are searching for 

Major problems

1.Fixing various errors of this program to find the accurate value


2.We have to face problem to use conditional statement for each calculation


3.We have to face problem to use the loop for the factorial value of a number


4.To improve the steps of finding the inverse trigonometric value


5.We have to figure out the introduction to the user in best way


6.To give the proper accurate value of its calculation


7.To clean all the garbage value


#Future Plan

There is a lots of plan for this project  we are working on.We can do calcuate the sum of add,subtract,multiply,factorial and so on.

There is a lots of feature which aren't shown in this pogram . In our next update you will able use those upcoming features.

All future works are in processing. Take  a look  all of our new features down below which will be added soon.  

1. You will able to find out two equations variable numbers value of x,y


2. You will able to find out integral math solution in a minute

3. you will able to find any number of powers n (real number) value

4.You will able to see the divided form of any divided number

5.You will able to use base number option thus you can find out any numbers binary,hexadecimal,octal & so on

6. you can also store information if u want
